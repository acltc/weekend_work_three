# In this exercise, we've already implemented the class, and you have to write the 
# driver code. 
# This class represents a hotel reservation.

end


# Write your own driver code below! Make sure your code tests the following:
# The ability to change a room number even after a reservation has already been created
# The add_a_fridge method
# The add_a_crib method
# The add_a_custom_amenity method
